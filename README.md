# DfE Technical Guidance

How we build and operate products at the Department for Education. This repo
is inspired by (and steals shamelessly from) the [GDS Way](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital) and the
[Ministry of Justice Technical Guidance](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/#moj-technical-guidance).

It's built using the GOV.UK [tech-docs-template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template), and hosted on [GOV.UK PaaS][].

## Add a new guidance
See the [Adding a new guidance][/guides/adding-new-guidance] section.

## GOV.UK PaaS set-up
The application is called `dfe-technical-guidance` and is supported by the [Staticfile buildpack][] . It is deployed in the space
`technical-architecture`, in the `dfe` organisation.

The custom domain, SSL certificate and CDN are provided by the `technical-guidance` [cdn-route][] service.

The deploy workflow connects to paas using service account technical-architecture-paas@digital.education.gov.uk (a Google group).

The review apps are deployed to the `technical-architecture-dev` space and their name is suffixed by the PR number. There is no
cdn-route service, we simply use the default `.london.cloudapps.digital` domain.
