# DfE Technical Guidance

How we build and operate products at the Department for Education. This repo
is inspired by (and steals shamelessly from) the [GDS Way](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital) and the
[Ministry of Justice Technical Guidance](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/#moj-technical-guidance).

It's built using the GOV.UK [tech-docs-template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template), and hosted on [GOV.UK PaaS][].

## Getting started

To preview the site locally, we need to use the terminal.

Install Ruby and [Bundler][bundler], preferably with a [Ruby version
manager][rvm].

[rvm]: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#managers
[bundler]: http://bundler.io/

Once you have Ruby and Bundler set up, you can install this project's
dependencies by running the following in this directory:

```bash
bundle
```

This will install all required dependencies, including the [govuk-tech-docs gem] and
[middleman].

## Making documentation changes

To make changes edit the source files in the `source` folder. See "Adding a new guidance" page for details.

## Previewing

Whilst writing documentation, run a middleman server to preview how the
published version will look in the browser. After saving a change the preview in
the browser will automatically refresh.

The preview is only available on our own computer. Others will not be able to
access it if they are given the link.

Type the following to start the server:

```
make server
```

If all goes well something like the following output will be displayed:

```
== The Middleman is loading
== LiveReload accepting connections from ws://192.168.0.8:35729
== View your site at "http://Laptop.local:4567", "http://192.168.0.8:4567"
== Inspect your site configuration at "http://Laptop.local:4567/__middleman", "http://192.168.0.8:4567/__middleman"
```

You should now be able to view a live preview at http://localhost:4567.

## Build

If you want to preview the site exactly how it is published, you can build the static HTML files locally. It also helps debugging
issues by running in verbose mode. Type the following:

```
make build
```

This will create a `build` subfolder in the application folder which contains
the HTML and asset files ready to be published.

## Check links

To check all hypertext links inside the generated documentation are valid run:

```
make check-links
```

It will build the site and check all the links. It takes a few minutes.

## Publishing changes

Make sure to make changes in a branch. Every change should be reviewed in a pull request, no matter how minor, and we've enabled
[branch protection][] to enforce this.

Once the pull request is merged, the deploy Github action workflow runs the build and pushes the static site to GOV.UK PaaS.

You may ask for write permission to push directly to the repository, or you can create a fork and make a pull request from there instead.

## Accessibility testing

Install AXE [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd)
or [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/axe-devtools/) and analyse the pages using the developer tools.

Issues with the [tech-docs-gem](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem) and [govuk-frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend) should be
reported on the respective repository.

## Review apps

Every pull request builds a separate _review app_. It is a unique version of the documentation implementing the changes from
the pull request and pushed to GOV.UK PaaS with a unique URL so it can be shared and peer reviewed. The URL is posted in a
comment on the pull request.

Any change to the branch is automatically pushed to the review app after a few minutes.

When the pull request is closed or merged, the review app is deleted.

## GOV.UK PaaS set-up
The application is called `dfe-technical-guidance` and is supported by the [Staticfile buildpack][] . It is deployed in the space
`technical-architecture`, in the `dfe` organisation.

The custom domain, SSL certificate and CDN are provided by the `technical-guidance` [cdn-route][] service.

The deploy workflow connects to paas using service account technical-architecture-paas@digital.education.gov.uk (a Google group).

The review apps are deployed to the `technical-architecture-dev` space and their name is suffixed by the PR number. There is no
cdn-route service, we simply use the default `.london.cloudapps.digital` domain.
