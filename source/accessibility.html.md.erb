## Accessibility statement for the DfE Technical Guidance

This accessibility statement applies to the DfE Technical Guidance at [technical-guidance.education.gov.uk](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/).

This website is run by the architecture and developer communities at the Department for Education (DfE). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

+ change colours, contrast levels and fonts
+ zoom in up to 300% without problems
+ navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
+ navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
+ listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.
