## User needs

Users should be able to label metric data so that it is compatible with
UK Government PaaS Exporter metrics and common across applications.

```
<metric name>{<label name>=<label value>, ...}
```
  
## Principles

- **HELP**  Description of the Metric
- **TYPE**  Should be one of the [Prometheus Metric Types](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/)
- **Metric Name** The name of the metric should identify what it contains. 
- **Label Name** labels are used to differentiate the characteristics of the thing that is being measured
  
Where possible use the same metric name and label name across different applications. However, ensure that the value is consistent in scale and the data it
represents.

```
cpu_usage_percentage{ app="get-into-teaching-api" }  75 
cpu_usage_percentage{ app="get-teacher-training-adviser" }  30 
```
  
### Platform Specific Labels
When using the UK Government PaaS there are a number of values that are provided by the hosted environment, which can help identify where the data is from, such
as Organisation and Space. By providing this data it in a standard format, it allows the monitoring of platform wide information and common dashboards.

| Label | Purpose | Derived from |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| app | Application | from the Environment variable VCAP_APPLICATION (json) application_name.|
| exported_instance | Instance | from the Environment variable INSTANCE_INDEX|
| organisation | Organisation |from the Environment variable VCAP_APPLICATION (json) organisation_name|
| space | Space |  from the Environment variable VCAP_APPLICATION (json) space_name|
  
> **CAUTION**: Remember that every unique combination of key-value label pairs represents a new time series, which can dramatically increase the amount of data stored.
Do not use labels to store dimensions with high cardinality (many different label values), such as user IDs, email addresses, or other unbounded sets of values.  

### Examples

```  
# HELP metric_name Description of the metric
# TYPE metric_name type
# Comment that's not parsed by prometheus
cpu_usage_percentage{app="get-into-teaching-app", exported_instance="0" , organisation="dfe" , space="get-into-teaching-production" }  55
```
