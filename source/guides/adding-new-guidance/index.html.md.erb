In the [DfE Digital technology guidance repository](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/technology-guidance), in the `source` directory, create a
subdirectory representing the name of the guidance.

For example: `source/guides/govuk-paas`.

Inside the new directory, create an `index.html.md.erb` file following this pattern:

```markdown

title: The Title of Your Page

# <%%= current_page.data.title %>

Introduction of a couple of paragraphs to explain why the thing you're
writing a standard about is important.

## User needs

Why do we do this thing? Who is it helping?

## Principles

What broad approaches do we follow when we do this thing?

## Tools

What specific bits of software (commercial or open source) do
we use to help us do this thing?
```

Then make a pull request and inform maintainers in the `#architecture` Slack channel.

Secondary pages related to a guidance may be created in the same directory as `<title>.html.md.erb`. To hide them from the sidebar navigation, add
field `hide_in_navigation: true` to the page header.

The guidance must be reviewed and updated before the expiration date.
