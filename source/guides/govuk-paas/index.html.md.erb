GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a platform developed by [Government Digital Service (GDS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service)
and available for government departments to deploy applications and backend services. It is based on the widely used open source platform
[Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) and built on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).

Many DfE production applications run on GOV.UK PaaS like [Teaching vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/),
[Get into teaching](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/) or [Get help with tech](https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/).

You can request access to a sandbox space to explore GOV.UK PaaS for free. See [Exploring GOV.UK PaaS](#exploring-gov-uk-paas).

## Suitability

[Azure CIP](/guides/default-technology-stack/#azure) is the traditional platform for hosting services in DfE. When does it make sense to use GOV.UK PaaS?

### Standard web applications

GOV.UK PaaS runs applications in horizontally scalable, stateless Linux containers. It is not adapted to large stateful enterprise applications.

It is mainly aimed at [12-factor applications](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/architecture.html#12-factor-application-principles), which is a set of
good practices for web applications to ensure smooth operations, scalability and consistency across environments. The service manual
[recommends](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/deploying-software-regularly#managing-variable-configuration) this architecture.

Native Windows applications will not run. However, .NET Core is supported as it runs on Linux.

### Rapid development

The traditional Azure platform may require specialised engineers and more time to set up and manage. GOV.UK PaaS provides the
ability to spin environments up/down without infrastructure expertise, enabling prototyping and fast iteration, which is particularly useful in
Discovery and Alpha. Some teams use [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) to deploy a prototype quickly. GOV.UK PaaS provides similar features but government
hosted and cheaper.

Also, it allows short lived environments created for the unique purpose of validating a new feature, similar to
[Heroku review apps](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration-review-apps). This allows for ephemeral/temporary environments to be
created and disposed "on the fly" and removes the contention usually observed when sharing environments.

### Low cost

GOV.UK PaaS is particularly adapted to services with budget constraints as total cost is lower than full IaaS. Cost of hosting is usually lower than
Azure but most of the savings will come from the lower dependency on dedicated infrastructure engineers.

Specialist engineers may still be requested on an ad hoc basis for guidance and to make sure the application is production ready.

### Simple infrastructure

Setting up a web application in the cloud involves a significant number of non-functional requirements such as providing internet access, container
scheduling, load balancing, scalability, monitoring, user access management, billing etc. A platform-as-a-service
[includes them already](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/overview.html) so the developer doesn't have to implement them.

As a result, setting up an application does not require full time infrastructure specialists or ops engineers. However, the set-up is limited to what
is available in the platform: see [application development](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/application-development/) and
[constraints](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/constraints/).

A limited number of [backing services](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/application-development/#backing-services) are provided: PostgreSQL, MySQL,
Redis, Elasticsearch, AWS S3, and InfluxDB. They run in the platform and cannot be accessed externally but can be easily linked to your application in
a GOV.UK PaaS container.

Application logs and performance metrics are [available in the platform](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/monitoring_apps.html#monitoring-apps) in
standard format and can be accessed manually, via the web portal or via external tools. The platform itself doesn't provide log storage or custom
visualisations.

### Security: Up to OFFICIAL data

The platform is [assured for use at OFFICIAL](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/security/#our-safety-measures). As the data owner for a service
[you must ensure that appropriate controls are in place when handling Official data](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/official-sensitive-data-and-it).

The platform is multi tenant: the resources are shared between different users and each one has dedicated access to the resources, with clear access
control policies. Users are other government departments. Some very specific applications might require total isolation which the platform does not
provide.

### Connectivity: Internet only

The platform runs in a public cloud: inbound and outbound connections are exclusively via public Internet. Traditional network based security via
dedicated network links, VPN, IP restrictions cannot be used.

Instead, transport security is achieved by using HTTPS/TLS and authentication via username/password or a single-sign-on integration such as with
OAuth or SAML (DfE Sign-in is supported), or several types of API authentication. This is handled at the application level. This is a "cloud first"
approach as specified in the Technology Code of Practice.

## Organisations and spaces
To separate users, applications, services and ultimately costs, GOV.UK PaaS provides
[organisations and spaces](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/orgs_spaces_users.html#managing-organisations-spaces-and-users).

<%= image_tag('orgs_and_spaces.svg', alt: 'Org and spaces in DfE') %>

### Organisations
DfE manages a GOV.UK PaaS organisation called `dfe`.

### Spaces
Developers in each service should have a space to push apps and services. Each space represents one or more environments for a service. For example,
service "abcd" may own spaces "abcd-dev", "abcd-staging", "abcd-production". Naming of spaces is not mandated but should be explicit.

Each space may have a different set of user permissions as developers in mature teams should not be able to push to production manually, unless
explicitly given permission to. Ideally only CI/CD systems should be able to make changes in production. Developers in a service don't have access to
another service’s applications, unless explicitly given permission, on as granular a basis as required.

### Management
Management of the platform is done by GDS. Management of the DfE resources is done by DfE:

* Create/Delete spaces
* Add/Remove users to the platform
* Designate "space manager" users who are responsible for adding/removing users to their spaces
* Designate "billing manager" users who are responsible for the spaces bills
* Invoice the finance team responsible for each space
* Create DNS domains

Requests are raised via [the service portal](https://dfe.service-now.com.mcas.ms/serviceportal/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0659b8c81bc7a0502fe864606e4bcb63&sysparm_category=19d07bc3dbff17003b929334ca9619bd).
An `@education.gov.uk` account is required, as well as [access to the service portal](https://dfe.service-now.com.mcas.ms/serviceportal/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=09927632dbe6d0509402e1aa4b9619b5) for BYOD users.

If you can't access the service portal, someone who has access can raise the request for you.

Finally, you can ask in #digital-tools-support Slack channel or via email to [digital-tools-support@digital.education.gov.uk](mailto:digital-tools-support@digital.education.gov.uk).

## Temporary privileged access
To allow rapid response to incidents, privilege escalation is done by the space managers. It is currently a manual process and they are responsible to
revoke the privilege when it is not needed anymore. It is possible to
[run a script](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/bat-infrastructure/blob/main/scripts/check-users-in-space-developer-role.ps1) regularly to confirm we
only see the expected space users.

## Exploring GOV.UK PaaS
If you are interested in adopting this platform and would like to explore it, request a new user. By default you will be given access to
the _sandbox_ space where you can deploy anything on a temporary basis. Please be mindful that creating resources is not free so delete them as soon
as possible.

## Onboarding a service
If you are planning to use GOV.UK PaaS in production, you will need one or more spaces (See [Organisations and spaces](#organisations-and-spaces)),
dedicated to your service.
Finance must be agreed as you will be responsible for the bills. The required details are shown on the service portal form.

## Adding a user to the platform
Any DfE user with an _@education.gov.uk_ or _@digital.education.gov.uk_ address can have an account on the platform. By default they will have access
to the sandbox space only. Access to particular spaces can also be requested, but it is preferably provided by the existing space managers.

Here are the space roles available:
* *SpaceManager*, only for managers, senior developers, tech leads or devops engineers
* *SpaceDeveloper* for developers. Only for non-production spaces.
* *SpaceAuditor* for readonly access

And one organisation level role:
* *BillingManager* to access billing data and current spending

## Support

For technical issues or guidance, the DfE infrastructure engineers can help you. Reach out on #devops-community Slack channel.

The team at GDS can be reached on [cross-government slack](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/) in the #govuk-paas channel during office hours.
They always have one dedicated engineer on support who will answer queries.

The platform is [supported 24x7](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/#supported-24-hours-a-day-7-days-a-week) by the GOV.UK PaaS team and they can be
reached using the form linked or via email. Support requests are tracked via Zendesk tickets.

In case of suspected outage, always check [the status page](https://status.cloud.service.gov.uk/). It is highly recommended to subscribe to the
mailing list (linked on the status page) to learn about potential disruptions.

## Tooling

### cf cli

The default tool to deploy to GOV.UK PaaS is the [cf command line tool](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/get_started.html#set-up-the-cloud-foundry-command-line).
It is easy to use and any developer can use it to push applications and create services like postgres or redis.

When deploying with the cli, we recommend using [manifests](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html):

* It avoids passing multiple options on the command line
* Manifests can be stored in the git repository
* Secrets or variables can be passed at deploy time

### Terraform
The Cloud Foundry provider for Terraform allows describing the deployment in a declarative way. It is the recommended way for robust deployments and
continuous delivery pipelines.

#### Why

* The declarative syntax avoids having to think about dependencies. Terraform will create the resources in the right order and destroy them in the
right order when required. It also makes it idempotent so terraform won’t recreate a resource already created.
* This is particularly useful to create disposable environments for testing or review apps, and delete them when they are not required anymore.
* The syntax is elegant, powerful and modular
* It can read data from environment variables, AWS parameter store, Azure keyvault, yaml files, json files, etc.
* It can create an environment made of very different technologies. For example, we create an environment with Azure, GOV.UK PaaS and Statuscake in a single Terraform run.

#### Caution

* Terraform requires to store its state in a persistent storage. An IaaS solution may be used alongside GOV.UK PaaS, like an Azure Storage Account or
AWS S3 bucket. GOV.UK PaaS also provides an [Amazon S3 service](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_services/s3/).
* All the resources are under Terraform control, including databases. It is a good practice to back up critical databases externally as an additional
protection. Terraform [prevent_destroy lifecycle](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle.html#prevent_destroy) may help as well.

#### Cloud Foundry provider
The Cloud Foundry community maintains the [Cloud Foundry Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudfoundry-community/cloudfoundry/latest/docs).

It can be easily downloaded and installed on Terraform 0.13 and above with:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cloudfoundry = {
      source = "cloudfoundry-community/cloudfoundry"
      version = "~> 0.14"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Zero downtime

By default when an application is pushed to GOV.UK PaaS, the live version is deleted, the new version is built, then the new version becomes live.
This can create a few minutes downtime.

To avoid this issue, the provider offers an elegant [blue-green](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudfoundry-community/cloudfoundry/latest/docs/resources/app#application-deployment-strategy-blue-green-deploy)
deployment strategy. It builds the new version alongside the live one, and it switches traffic to it smoothly when it’s up and running.

### Docker

The default option to deploy an application to GOV.UK PaaS is using buildpacks. They are preconfigured environments for a variety of programming
languages. The developer pushes their code using `cf push` and Cloud Foundry will build it remotely using the relevant buildpack. This is **not** the
DfE recommended way to deploy to GOV.UK PaaS, except for very simple applications like static websites.

Another solution is to use Docker. Using `cf push --docker-image my-app` tells Cloud Foundry to:

* Pull the my-app image from a docker registry (Docker Hub by default)
* Unpack the files
* Run the application in Cloud Foundry container environment

This approach has several advantages:

* Avoid vendor lock-in: Docker is commonly used in other platform like Kubernetes, Azure app service, Azure container instances, AWS ECS, etc. Should
we want to move away from GOV.UK PaaS, it’s possible.
* Build only once: The Docker image is a build artifact identified by a specific tag (usually the commit id). It can be deployed consistently across
different environments.
* Faster deployments: The deployment to each environment only takes a few seconds as the image is already built.
* Faster build: Docker build cache can be leveraged to reduce built time massively.

The terraform Cloud Foundry provider also supports Docker.

**Important:** If you use Docker Hub as Docker registry, make sure to set up authentication as unauthenticated pulls are significantly
[rate limited](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/).
