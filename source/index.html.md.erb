This site documents the technical standards and guidance that we expect teams working
within the [Department for Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education)
to follow when building digital services.

It complements the [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) and its
[Technology section](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology),
which covers service design more broadly.

It is inspired by the [GDS Way](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital) and the
[Ministry of Justice Technical Guidance](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/#moj-technical-guidance).

Introduction of a couple of paragraphs to explain why the thing you're
writing a standard about is important.

## User needs

Why do we do this thing? Who is it helping?

## Principles

What broad approaches do we follow when we do this thing?

## Tools

What specific bits of software (commercial or open source) do
we use to help us do this thing?
```

The service manual has some useful information on
[learning about and writing user needs](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs).
