This site documents the technical standards and guidance that we expect teams working
within the [Department for Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education)
to follow when building digital services.

It complements the [DfE Service manual](https://service-manual.education.gov.uk/), [DfE Architecture](https://dfe-digital.github.io/architecture/#dfe-architecture)
and the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual).

Useful tools and patterns are presented to help with code reuse, security and consistency.
