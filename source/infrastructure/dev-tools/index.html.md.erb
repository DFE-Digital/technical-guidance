## Azure CLI
The Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a cross-platform command-line tool to connect to Azure and execute administrative commands on Azure resources. It allows the execution of commands through a terminal using interactive command-line prompts or a script.

[How to Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

## Cloud Foundry CLI
Cloud Foundry is an open source cloud computing platform. It is the platform the [UK Gov PaaS](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/) is delivered on.

## GIT
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

## Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently.

### Installation
Follow these [instructions](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).

### Versions
When installing Terraform locally it is important to make sure you have a version that matches the Github version.

- Pin the version in a GitHub Actions workflow:

    ```yaml
    - name: Pin Terraform version
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
        with:
        terraform_version: 0.13.1
    ```
- Pin the version in Terraform code (e.g. versions.tf):

    ```hcl
    terraform {
        required_version = ">= 0.13.1"
    }
    ```

### Install a matching version locally

To allow you to manage multiple versions locally, it is suggested to use [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv):

- Install: `brew install tfenv`
- List remote available versions: `tfenv list-remote`
- Install a specific version: `tfenv install 0.13.1`
- List all versions which are installed locally: `tfenv list`
- Use a specific version: `tfenv use 0.13.1`

### State
Terraform keeps a register of all the resources it has created in a long json file called the _state file_. This allows keeping them under control to validate configuration, update or remove them. To work in a team and in automation, terraform provides [remote storage](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/remote) so the state can be shared.
We recommend storing it as a [Blob Container within the Blob Storage Account](https://www.terraform.io/language/settings/backends/azurerm)

Since the state is critical, we strongly recommend using [versioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/versioning-overview). This allows restoring the state in case it’s deleted or restoring a previous version in case it’s corrupted or updated by mistake (new terraform version for instance).
[Soft delete for blobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/soft-delete-blob-overview) and [soft delete for containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/soft-delete-container-overview) are important too.

## Ruby

### Using RVM

1. install homebrew, this will ask to install the xcode command line tools if you dont have it already
Run `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`
2. install gpg2
Run `brew install gpg2`
3. import the RVM keys *do not use these keys* get them from the official website (https://rvm.io/rvm/security) as they change often
Run `gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB`
4. trust the first key
Run `echo 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3:6: | gpg2 --import-ownertrust # mpapis@gmail.com`
5. install rvm
Run `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`
6. enable rvm (replace <your-user-name>)
Run `source /Users/<your-user-name>/.rvm/scripts/rvm`
7. install ruby 2.7.4
Run `rvm install ruby 2.7.4`
8. switch your system to use ruby 2.7.4`
Run `rvm use 2.7.4`
9. install yarn
Run `brew install yarn`

## Asdf

### Introduction

[Asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) is a version manager used for managing software you install on your computer, it’s a command line interface
tool that handles installing multiple versions of software packages, allowing you to switch between those versions at runtime.
Ruby and Terraform are examples of software which can be managed using `asdf`. As the `.tool-versions` file is committed to the
repository, it ensures consistency among developers.

Each software package is managed by a plugin, here is the official [list of plugins](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins).

### Installation

The required versions of project dependencies are defined in the `.tool-versions` file of the repository and these can be automatically installed using
`asdf`. Their installation instructions can be found [here](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#_1-install-dependencies).

### Commands

- Install a plugin: `asdf plugin add <plugin_name>`
- List installed plugins: `asdf plugin list`
- List installed versions of a plugin: `asdf list <plugin_name>`
- List all possible versions of a plugin: `asdf list <plugin_name> all`
- Install specific version of a plugin: `asdf install <plugin_name> <plugin_version>`
- Update the `.tool-versions` file with a new plugin version: `asdf local <plugin_name> <plugin_version>`
