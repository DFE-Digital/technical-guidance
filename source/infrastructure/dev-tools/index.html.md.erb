## Azure CLI
The Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a cross-platform command-line tool to connect to Azure and execute administrative commands on Azure resources. It allows the execution of commands through a terminal using interactive command-line prompts or a script.

[How to Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

## Cloud Foundry CLI
Cloud Foundry is an open source cloud computing platform. It is the platform the [UK Gov PaaS](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/) is delivered on.

## GIT
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

## Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently.

### Installation
Follow these [instructions](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).

### Versions
When installing Terraform locally it is important to make sure you have a version that matches the Github version.

- Pin the version in a GitHub Actions workflow:

    ```yaml
    - name: Pin Terraform version
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
        with:
        terraform_version: 0.13.1
    ```
- Pin the version in Terraform code (e.g. versions.tf):

    ```hcl
    terraform {
        required_version = ">= 0.13.1"
    }
    ```

### Install a matching version locally

To allow you to manage multiple versions locally, it is suggested to use [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv):

- Install: `brew install tfenv`
- List remote available versions: `tfenv list-remote`
- Install a specific version: `tfenv install 0.13.1`
- List all versions which are installed locally: `tfenv list`
- Use a specific version: `tfenv use 0.13.1`

### State
Terraform keeps a register of all the resources it has created in a long json file called the _state file_. This allows keeping them under control to validate configuration, update or remove them. To work in a team and in automation, terraform provides [remote storage](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/remote) so the state can be shared.
We recommend storing it as a [Blob Container within the Blob Storage Account](https://www.terraform.io/language/settings/backends/azurerm)

Since the state is critical, we strongly recommend using [versioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/versioning-overview). This allows restoring the state in case it’s deleted or restoring a previous version in case it’s corrupted or updated by mistake (new terraform version for instance).
[Soft delete for blobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/soft-delete-blob-overview) and [soft delete for containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/soft-delete-container-overview) are important too.

## Ruby

### Using RVM

1. install homebrew, this will ask to install the xcode command line tools if you dont have it already
Run `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`
2. install gpg2
Run `brew install gpg2`
3. import the RVM keys *do not use these keys* get them from the official website (https://rvm.io/rvm/security) as they change often
Run `gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB`
4. trust the first key
Run `echo 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3:6: | gpg2 --import-ownertrust # mpapis@gmail.com`
5. install rvm
Run `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`
6. enable rvm (replace <your-user-name>)
Run `source /Users/<your-user-name>/.rvm/scripts/rvm`
7. install ruby 2.7.4
Run `rvm install ruby 2.7.4`
8. switch your system to use ruby 2.7.4`
Run `rvm use 2.7.4`
9. install yarn
Run `brew install yarn`
