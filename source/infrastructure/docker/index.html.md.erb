## Installing Docker
You will need access to docker-users group on the system user groups of your machine in order to run docker and possibly an update to the wsl kernal (achieve this by requesting a meeting with system administrator who will be able to screen share and run the update for you)

Requests should be made through the service portal, Access to restricted Groups and DFE sign-in requests along with your request for desktop-docker all will need to be raised by your DM or TL. Once complete it will appear in your software centre for you to install. For more information go here [install docker on windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

## Operating Desktop-Docker
Once installed start the application by clicking on the desktop icon added during installation.


## Build An Image

To get started, follow the steps below:

* Navigate to the Visual Studio code

* Click on `Terminal`, this is found in the main menu at the top of the visual studio code IDE

* Ensure you are in the cursor is in the terminal window at the end of the current directory

* Use command line to navigate to your local source repo 'CD'

* Create a new folder 'mkdir' new it the project name

* Navigate to the newly created folder

* Now in the ternimal window and the root of the folder type 'code .' this will open a new VSC IDE in the current project folder

* Make sure you have desktop docker running

* type in the terminal window 'npm init -y' this will build a simple project structure

* once complete type in the terminal 'npm install express' 

* Create a file called index.js and add it to the root directory

* Open index.js in the editor and add this line to the top of the file 

````

const express = require('express');

````

* Now below that add 

````

const app = express();

````

* and on the next line add 

````

app.use(express.json());

````
* Add to the next line

````

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

````
* Now and add 

```
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log("Server Listening on PORT:", PORT);
});
```
* Now you need to define a route in your project for this we will add a status to return running add the following to the index.js

````
app.get("/status", (request, response) => {
   const status = {
      "Status": "Running"
   };
   
   response.send(status);
});
````
* Open package.json file and add to the script section of the file

````
 "start": "node index.js" 
 
 ````
 making sure to add a comma to the end of the line above

* now in the terminal window type 'npm start'

* you should see a project start command a node command and server listening on the port number 3000

* to close the server with the cursor in the terminal window select 'CTRL + C' and select 'Y'

* Once successfully set up you are ready to add docker

* Select 'View' from the top menu of yyou visual studio code IDE

* Click command Pallet

* In the command pallet at the > type Docker a list will appear select 'Add Docker Compose Files To Workspace'

* next select application platform 'NODEJS'

* Next select the script that hold your start command 'package.json' file

* Next select the port default is 3000

* VSC will then prompt you to add a docker file select yes

* VSC has now added all the files necessary to run your project in docker by issuing commands to your compose file

* To test this select one of the compose files right click and select 'Compose Up'

* VSC will now build your image and your container and start it running which can be seen in the terminal window

* Once started you can go back to your browser and enter 'http://localhost:3000/status' the browser should return 
````
{
  "Status": "Running"
}
````
