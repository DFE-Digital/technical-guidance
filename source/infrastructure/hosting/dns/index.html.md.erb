Domain names are normally maintained by the [Infrastructure Operations](/infrastructure/support/#infrastructure-operations) team. They own a number of AWS route53 zones, including:

* education.gov.uk and *.education.gov.uk: default zones for DfE domains

* *.service.gov.uk for [public beta and live services](#official-service.gov.uk-domains) linked from gov.uk. Example: [find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/) or [apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/)

## Service Now

Changes are requested via the [Service portal](<%= data.site.service_portal %>). Process:

* Request something
* Categories: Non-standard
* Any other request
* Category: Non-standard
* Business service: Shared IT core services
* Service offering: Amazon Web Services

*For live services, the changes may have to go through CAB if there is a risk of disruption*

### Request subdomain or other record type
Example: create a CNAME record service123.education.gov.uk pointing to domain service123.azurewebsites.net:

```
Please create the following record in DNS zone education.gov.uk:
service123.education.gov.uk IN CNAME service123.azurewebsites.net
```

Example: create an A record service456.education.gov.uk pointing to IP address 10.11.12.13:

```
Please create the following record in DNS zone education.gov.uk:
service456.education.gov.uk IN A 10.11.12.13
```

Example: create a TXT record _87fa63d9b0fbe.education.gov.uk with value 0e8193849.tfmgdnztqk.validate-example.net :

```
Please create the following record in DNS zone education.gov.uk:
_87fa63d9b0fbe.education.gov.uk IN TXT _87fa63d9b0fbe.education.gov.uk
```

Optionally ask to set the TTL on the record. The default is 300s (5 min). Be careful with long TTL as mistakes may create longer outages.

### Request zone
```
Please create a new DNS zone called service123.service.gov.uk
```

## Official service.gov.uk domains

The [GOV.UK proposition](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/govuk-proposition/govuk-proposition) lays out what should get a `service.gov.uk` domain. In the DfE, we interpet that as follows:

- If a service is actively targeting the use of itself by externals (including schools and local authorities) then it should be a part of service.gov.uk 
- Services should be assessed internally if they'll have fewer than 100K transations, by an external GDS assessment if they'll have more than 100K transactions
- If a service is available publicly but targets internals (including contracted suppliers), or if it's private (for example an intranet, or an IP restricted extranet) then it can be on `education.gov.uk` or anything else we wish to use

During alpha and private beta phases, services usually run under the education.gov.uk domain. When a service passes the [public beta assessment](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-live-phase-works), it should get an official service.gov.uk domain and a start page.



As [documented](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/get-a-domain-name), we need to:

* Create a new DNS zone `<service>.service.gov.uk`. Example: [apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk](http://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/)
* Take note of the name servers. Example:

  ```
  % dig +short ns apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk
  ns-1034.awsdns-01.org.
  ns-1700.awsdns-20.co.uk.
  ns-736.awsdns-28.net.
  ns-485.awsdns-60.com.
  ```
* Send the request to GDS by emailing <govuk-enquiries@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk> or <hostmaster@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk>. Mention the desired zone name and the name servers.
* GDS will then set up delegation from their zone `service.gov.uk`
* Create the required subdomains `<subdomain>.<service>.service.gov.uk`. Example: [www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/)
* Domains for test environments may also be created as subdomains. Example: [staging.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk](https://staging.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk)

## Start page

Each service must have a start page on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk) website, which briefly describes the service and let the user navigate to the service under the mandatory service.gov.uk domain. The GOV.UK Design System has documentation on the [‘start using a service’ pattern](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/start-pages/) which describes the different options.
