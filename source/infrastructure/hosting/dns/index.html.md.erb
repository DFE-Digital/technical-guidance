Domain names are normally maintained by the Tech Group Infrastructure team. They own a number of AWS route53 zones, including:

* education.gov.uk and *.education.gov.uk: default zones for DfE domains

* *.service.gov.uk for public beta and live services linked from gov.uk. Example: [find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/) or [apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/)

### Request subdomain or other record type
Example: create a CNAME record service123.education.gov.uk pointing to domain service123.azurewebsites.net:

```
Please create the following record in DNS zone education.gov.uk:
service123.education.gov.uk IN CNAME service123.azurewebsites.net
```

Example: create an A record service456.education.gov.uk pointing to IP address 10.11.12.13:

```
Please create the following record in DNS zone education.gov.uk:
service456.education.gov.uk IN A 10.11.12.13
```

Example: create a TXT record _87fa63d9b0fbe.education.gov.uk with value 0e8193849.tfmgdnztqk.validate-example.net :

```
Please create the following record in DNS zone education.gov.uk:
_87fa63d9b0fbe.education.gov.uk IN TXT _87fa63d9b0fbe.education.gov.uk
```

Optionally ask to set the TTL on the record. The default is 300s (5 min).

### Request zone
```Please create a new DNS zone called service123.service.gov.uk```


## Official service.gov.uk domains

During alpha and private beta phases, services usually run under the education.gov.uk domain. When a service passes the [public beta assessment](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-live-phase-works), it should get an official service.gov.uk domain and a start page.

## service.gov.uk domain
As [documented](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/get-a-domain-name), we need to:

* Create a new DNS zone `<service>.service.gov.uk`. Example: [apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk](http://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/)
* Take note of the name servers.

Example:

```
% dig +short ns apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk
ns-1034.awsdns-01.org.
ns-1700.awsdns-20.co.uk.
ns-736.awsdns-28.net.
ns-485.awsdns-60.com.
```

* Create a ticket with GDS by emailing <hostmaster@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk>. Mention the desired zone name and the name servers.

* GDS will then set up delegation from their zone `service.gov.uk`

* Create the required subdomains <subdomain>.<service>.service.gov.uk. Example: [www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk](http://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/)

## Start page

Each service must have a start page on [GOV.UK](http://gov.uk/) website, which briefly describes the service and let the user navigate to the service under the mandatory service.gov.uk domain. The GOV.UK Design System has documentation on the [‘start using a service’ pattern](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/start-pages/) which describes the different options.
