GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a platform developed by [Government Digital Service (GDS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service)
and available for government departments to deploy applications and backend services. It is based on the widely used open source platform
[Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) and built on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).

Many DfE production applications run on GOV.UK PaaS like [Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/),
[Get into teaching](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/) or [Get help with tech](https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/).
