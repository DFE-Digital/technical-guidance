## Service accounts
Automation requires creating a PaaS service account, which is a user account with its own email address, but not related to a human user.

### Shared email
The first step is to create a shared email account. See [Service accounts](/infrastructure/security/service-accounts/).

### Create the GOV.UK PaaS user
Follow the standard process to [request a new user](/infrastructure/hosting/govuk-paas/overview/#create-user) using and the details of the group you created above.

It is recommended to keep a copy of the password in your production [Azure key vault](/infrastructure/security/managing-secrets/).

[Add the user to the spaces](/infrastructure/hosting/govuk-paas/overview/#user-permissions) with the right role.

## Temporary privileged access
To allow rapid response to incidents, privilege escalation is done by the space managers. It is currently a manual process and they are responsible to
revoke the privilege when it is not needed anymore. It is possible to
[run a script](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/bat-infrastructure/blob/main/scripts/check-users-in-space-developer-role.ps1) regularly to confirm we
only see the expected space users.

## Revoke privileged access automatically
Privileged should not be permanent. You can run a script to remove user access on a daily basis.

For example:

- [Script](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/bat-infrastructure/blob/main/scripts/check-users-in-space-developer-role.ps1)
- [Workflow](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/bat-infrastructure/blob/main/.github/workflows/check-users-in-space-developer-role.yml)

This requires a service account with `SpaceManager` role to be able to unset user roles.
