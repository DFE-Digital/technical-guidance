If you want a dynamic drop down list for a dashboard the first step is to create a query variable, doing this will allow us to reuse common dashboards and allow dashboards to be clearer.

## Example

The UK Gov PaaS consists of organisations and spaces. A dashboard will not generally span different organisations but may well use different spaces. Also if you use the dashboard in a different organisation then the list of spaces will be different.

## Variable

You should look at your data and see what labels you have available to use. This can easily be done by going to your Prometheus ( or other data source ) instance and querying back the raw data. In our example we are interested in **memory_utilization** so a simple selection of memory_utilization yields.


### Example 1
```
memory_utilization{app="alertmanager-dev-get-into-teaching",exported_instance="0",guid="cdd26aed-1041-4263-9330-b541ff233df5",instance="paas-prometheus-exporter-prod-get-into-teaching.london.cloudapps.digital:443",job="PaaS Prometheus Exporter",organisation="dfe-teacher-services",space="get-into-teaching"}
```

### Example 2
```
memory_utilization{app="alertmanager-prod-get-into-teaching",exported_instance="0",guid="3fee9a22-0881-468e-8d6c-6e3b7db0b5fe",instance="paas-prometheus-exporter-prod-get-into-teaching.london.cloudapps.digital:443",job="PaaS Prometheus Exporter",organisation="dfe-teacher-services",space="get-into-teaching-monitoring"}
```

You can see there are some useful labels, in our case we are interested in space.

## Grafana Variable

So we need to go to our dashboard and using the ‘COG’ at the top of the dashboard add a new variable. This should be a query variable and you should enter:

![Example of Dynamic Variables](dynamic_variables.png)

The key value is label_value( space ), this returns all the labels named ‘space’ into the variable. [Documentation](https://docs.huihoo.com/grafana/2.6/datasources/prometheus/index.html)

You should notice when you have created your variable it gives an example of the data it has returned. If this looks good, you are ready to ADD the variable.

## Using Variable

You should now notice a populated drop down list at the top of your dashboard, now it is a simple case of including the setting in your panels.
