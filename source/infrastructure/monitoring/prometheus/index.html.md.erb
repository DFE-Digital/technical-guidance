[Back to Monitoring](/infrastructure/monitoring/)

#  <%= current_page.data.title %>

[GOV.UK PaaS](<%= data.site.gov_uk_paas %>) doesnâ€™t provide monitoring tools natively. It provides logs and metrics which can be streamed to a separate monitoring solution.

The prometheus ecosystem is a good fit for PaaS. It is made up of various components:

### Exporters
Provides metrics on the `/metrics` http endpoint. We use exporters for PaaS, Redis, Postgres, Rails...

### Prometheus
Prometheus is the brains of the system providing the following functions:

* Scrap metrics from the exporters
* Store metrics in a database
* Manage threshold based alerts
* Provides a web interface to query the data, return metrics and graph them

### Influxdb
Is a time series database to store metrics reliably and query them.

### Alertmanager
Receives alerts from prometheus and notifies users on various channels.

### Grafana
Reads the metrics from various datasources including influxdb to create advanced graphs and dashboards.

#### Further Reading
* [Dynamic Variables](/infrastructure/monitoring/grafana/dynamic_variables.html)

### Delivery
We have created reusable terraform modules to deploy the whole solution easily and reliably. See: [cf-monitoring](https://dfe-digital.github.io/cf-monitoring/)
