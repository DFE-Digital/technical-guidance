### Exporters
Provides metrics on the `/metrics` http endpoint. We use exporters for Redis, Postgres, Rails...

### Prometheus
Prometheus is the brains of the system providing the following functions:

* Scrap metrics from the exporters
* Store metrics in a database
* Manage threshold based alerts
* Provides a web interface to query the data, return metrics and graph them

### Influxdb
Is a time series database to store metrics reliably and query them.

### Thanos
Alternative to Influxdb to store metrics using different storage backends, including Azure storage accounts.

### Alertmanager
Receives alerts from prometheus and notifies users on various channels.

### Grafana
Reads the metrics from various datasources including influxdb to create advanced graphs and dashboards.
