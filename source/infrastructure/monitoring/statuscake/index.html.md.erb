#  <%= current_page.data.title %>

Statuscake is a cloud based tool used to constantly monitor the availability of websites and alert when they are not present.

### Access to the DfE account
Use the [StatusCake form](https://dfe.service-now.com.mcas.ms/serviceportal/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=e7a004df1b399c502fe864606e4bcb21),
choose *Request account access* and enter your email address. This will give you access to the DFEStatusCake subaccount and you will be able to see
all checks in DfE, modify contact groups and integrations. Checks can't be created manually, it is only allowed via an API key.

### Request API key
Each service or service area (shared key) can request an API key to create the checks via automation. Use the [StatusCake form](https://dfe.service-now.com.mcas.ms/serviceportal/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=e7a004df1b399c502fe864606e4bcb21),
choose *Request API key*. Enter the team's email address and the name of the service or service area.

### Contact Group
Create a contact group for each team manually using the statuscake GUI.

### Alerts
It is possible to have a number of emails and mobile numbers for alerts when a site is unavailble.

### Integration
It is possible for a Slack message to be raised. You will need a Slack Webhook, which can be provided on request by [Digital tools](<%= data.site.digital_tools %>).

### Delivery
It is recommended to use Terraform:

*tfvars* file

```hcl
alerts = { # Several different checks per environment can be configured
  GiT_App_Production_Healthcheck = {
    website_name  = "Get Into Teaching Website (Production)"                    # Name of the service and environment
    website_url   = "https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/healthcheck.json" # Simple healtheck page with no dependency
    test_type     = "HTTP"
    check_rate    = 30                                                          # Set to minimum
    contact_group = ["Get-Into-Teaching"]
    trigger_rate  = 0                                                           # Set to 0 to alert immediately
    confirmations = 1                                                           # Set to 1 or more to eliminate false alarms
    node_locations = [ "UKINT", "UK1", "MAN1", "MAN5", "DUB2"],                 # Limit the number of check locations
  }
}
```

```hcl
provider "statuscake" {
  username = var.sc-username
  apikey   = var.sc-password
}

terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.13.4"
  required_providers {
    statuscake = {
      source  = "StatusCakeDev/statuscake"
      version = "1.0.1"
    }
  }

resource "statuscake_test" "alert" {
  for_each = var.alerts

  website_name   = each.value.website_name
  website_url    = each.value.website_url
  test_type      = each.value.test_type
  check_rate     = each.value.check_rate
  contact_group  = each.value.contact_group
  trigger_rate   = each.value.trigger_rate
  confirmations  = each.value.confirmations
  node_locations = each.value.node_locations
}
```
