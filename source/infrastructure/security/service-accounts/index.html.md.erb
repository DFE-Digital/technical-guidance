Service accounts are user accounts on various systems like GOV.UK PaaS, Github, Azure usually required by automation. They are not related to a human user to avoid the risk of stopping
the automation when the user is offboarded. This requires shared credentials so care should be taken to be able to share them in a secure way.

- For non email based credentials like Azure service principals, add the keys to the production [keyvault protected by PIM](/infrastructure/security/managing-secrets).
- For email based credentials like GOV.UK Paas, Github, Dockerhub, a useful pattern is to use a shared email. It provides a unique email address used to register the account agains the system. The human owners of the service accounts are made members of the shared email
and are able to reset the password. See below.

## Shared email

### Google Group
For `@digital.education.gov.uk` email addresses:

Decide on a reasonable name for you service account; fill in this form and inform [Digital tools](<%= data.site.digital_tools %>) on SLACK that you have put in the request

* Request the group is created using the [Google Group Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScEp4GBH-oBGsZR94XxTivad5YempL6VJeKlIUG3x-Mpyj0eA/viewform).
	* You will be asked to name the group manager, this needs to be someone with an @digital.education.gov.uk email address. We suggest that this is a permanent member of the Infrastructure team.
	* The group name should be logical and represent the project and purpose of the group.
	* You should list all the team members who require access, though if you are going to be a manager of the group, it can be can be changed later.
	* We advise that you inform [Digital tools](<%= data.site.digital_tools %>) that are creating the group, it will be used as a Service Account.
* Ensure that there is more than one member of the group.
* Ensure you receive a confirmation email after you have submitted the form.

### Outlook shared mailbox
For `@education.gov.uk` email addresses, create a shared mailbox using
[the service portal form](https://dfe.service-now.com.mcas.ms/serviceportal/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=5daf935837189240c033a16043990ecf&referrer=popular_items).

## GOV.UK PaaS account
Follow the above and see [GOV.UK PaaS service accounts](<%= data.site.gov_uk_paas %>production/#service-accounts).

## Github account
Request a new user from [Digital tools](<%= data.site.digital_tools %>).

2-factor authentication is mandated, it should be registered on a civil servant device. Recovery codes are generated and may be used by other developers to login.

A Personal Access Token (PAT) can then be generated and used in automation.

Password, recovery codes and PATs should be kept in your production [Azure key vault](/infrastructure/security/managing-secrets/).

## DockerHub account
Request a new user from [Digital tools](<%= data.site.digital_tools %>).

The password should be kept in your production [Azure key vault](/infrastructure/security/managing-secrets/).

## Azure service principal
See instructions in [CIP](/infrastructure/hosting/azure-cip/#service-principal) to create the service principal and how to use it.
