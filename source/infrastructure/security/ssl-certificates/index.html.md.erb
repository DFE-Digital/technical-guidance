We traditionnally request the certificates from the [Globalsign](https://www.globalsign.com/) DfE account.
The certificate can be created manually or generated and renewed automatically via Azure key vault, but it requires a Globalsign administrator account. Both automatic and manual options are presented here.

Certificates generated in Globalsign are paid for centrally by the [Platform support team](#support).

This documentation doesn't apply to [GOV.UK PaaS](<%= data.site.gov_uk_paas %>) as SSL certificates are generated and renewed automatically for each [custom domain](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_services/use_a_custom_domain/).

## Globalsign account
Use the [External Digital Certificates form](https://dfe.service-now.com.us.cas.ms/serviceportal?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=8fe3fae3dbd77f809402e1aa4b9619d0) on the service portal and choose: _Request type: Request an account_

## Generate manually
### Create CSR and private key
Here is the [Globalsign guidance](https://support.globalsign.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1229769-certificate-signing-request-csr---overview) about Certificate Signing Request (CSR).

Using openssl:

```
openssl req -nodes -out CSR.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privatekey.key
```

Use similar details as:

```
Country Name (2 letter code) []:GB
State or Province Name (full name) []:Greater Manchester
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Manchester
Organization Name (eg, company) []:Department for Education
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (eg, fully qualified host name) []:development.additional-teaching-payment.education.gov.uk (donâ€™t use a wildcard if possible, use multiple SANs instead)
Email Address []:capt-dev@digital.education.gov.uk (use a team email)
```

Keep the private key safe, for example in a production [key vault](http://localhost:4567/infrastructure/security/managing-secrets/).

### SAN: additional domain names
One certificate can cover mutiple domains in addition to the CN above by using Subject Alternate Names (SAN). **SANs are half the price of a full
certificate so they should be used whenever and wherever possible.**

This cannot be done interactively. Prepare an openssl config file, such as this _san.cnf_:

```
[ req ]
default_bits        = 2048
distinguished_name  = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions      = req_ext
[ req_distinguished_name ]
countryName         = GB
stateOrProvinceName = Greater Manchester
localityName        = Manchester
organizationName    = Department of Education
commonName          = additional-teaching-payment.education.gov.uk
[ req_ext ]
subjectAltName      = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1               = www.additional-teaching-payment.education.gov.uk
DNS.2               = staging.additional-teaching-payment.education.gov.uk
```

Then run:

```
openssl req -out sslcert.csr -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout private.key -config san.cnf
```

And confirm the answers interactively.

### Request new certificate in Globalsign
- Open [Globalsign](https://gcc.globalsign.com/au/signon/gacp/usernamePasswordLogin.do)
- Select _Managed SSL_
- Choose _Order Certificate_ from either _Department for Education_ or _Education & Skills Funding Agency_
- Paste the CSR created above
- Check this CSR, Continue
- Products: OrganizationSSL
- SSL Certificate Type: Single Domain Certificate
- Point of contact must have a team email email address, not an individual
- Tick box _Is this the Point of Contact for communications?_
- Continue until `Complete`

The _Platform support_ team will receive the request, validate and you will receive an email with the certificate in PEM (.cer) format.

### Convert to pfx format

It may be required to convert to pfx format, especially in Azure. It replaces pem certificate+private key with pfx certificate+password.

Using openssl:

```
openssl pkcs12 -export -out cert.pfx -inkey privatekey.key -in cert.cer
```

## Automatic via key vault

[Azure key vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/certificates/tutorial-rotate-certificates) can generate, renew and store the certificate automatically.

A Globasign administrator account is required and must be approved on case by case basis. It can be requested via the
[Non-standard / Any Other Request](https://dfe.service-now.com.mcas.ms/serviceportal?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=3ab186f8db2c2b403b929334ca961998&sysparm_category=19d07bc3dbff17003b929334ca9619bd)
service portal form. The business service is _Shared IT core services_ and the offering is _SSL Certificate Authority Systems (external)_.

- Configure the Globalsign Certificate Authority (CA) in key vault using the Globalsign admin account. The contact details should be for a team, not an individual.
- Create a certificate
  - Method: Generate
  - Name: Unique name (usually the subdomain)
  - Type of CA: integrated
  - CA: the CA created above
  - Subject (example):

    ```
    C=GB, ST=Greater Manchester, L=Manchester, O=Department for Education, CN=claim-additional-teaching-payment.service.gov.uk
    ```

  - DNS Names: list of additional domain names (SANs) to be covered by this certificate
  - Validity: 12 months
  - Content type: PKCS #12
  - Lifetime action type: Automatically renew at a given number of days before expiry
  - Number of days: 30
- Click Create
- Click Certificate Operation and wait for result

## Renewals

The certificates are monitored and owners are notified via email before expiry by either GlobalSign or the [Platform support team](#support).

## Check certificate

In order to view certificate expiry details such as expiry date, etc., you can run the following command to download the certificate currently being used on a website. In this example, we are focusing on _https://find-postgraduate-teacher-training.education.gov_.uk :

```
echo -n | openssl s_client -connect find-postgraduate-teacher-training.education.gov.uk:443 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > certoutput.cert
```

Once downloaded, you can run:

```
openssl x509 -in certoutput.cert -text
```
