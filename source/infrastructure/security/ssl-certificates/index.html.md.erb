We traditionally request certificates from one of our certified certificate authorities (CAs) [Globalsign](https://www.globalsign.com/) or [DigiCert](https://www.digicert.com/secure/) (currently our preferred provider).
This may alter between them depending on the procurement process (every 12 months). All users will be notified ahead of time should the supplier change.

The certificate can be created manually or generated and renewed automatically via Azure Key Vault. Both automatic and manual options are presented here.

Certificates generated on the CAs are paid for centrally by the [Platform support team](/infrastructure/support/#platform-support).

This documentation doesn't apply to [GOV.UK PaaS](<%= data.site.gov_uk_paas %>) as SSL certificates are generated and renewed automatically for each [custom domain](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_services/use_a_custom_domain/).
Similarly for Azure managed certificates in [App service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-certificate?tabs=apex%2Cportal#create-a-free-managed-certificate) or [Front door](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/standard-premium/how-to-configure-https-custom-domain#afd-managed-certificates-for-non-azure-pre-validated-domain).

## Create account
Use the [External Digital Certificates form](https://dfe.service-now.com.us.cas.ms/serviceportal?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=8fe3fae3dbd77f809402e1aa4b9619d0) on the service portal and choose: _Request type: Request an account_

## Generate manually
### Create CSR and private key
Using [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/):

```
openssl req -nodes -out CSR.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privatekey.key
```

Use similar details as:

```
Country Name (2 letter code) []:GB
State or Province Name (full name) []:Greater Manchester
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Manchester
Organization Name (eg, company) []:Department for Education
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (eg, fully qualified host name) []:development.additional-teaching-payment.education.gov.uk (donâ€™t use a wildcard if possible, use multiple SANs instead)
Email Address []:capt-dev@digital.education.gov.uk (use a team email)
```

Keep the private key safe, for example in a production [key vault](http://localhost:4567/infrastructure/security/managing-secrets/).

### SAN: additional domain names
One certificate can cover mutiple domains in addition to the CN above by using Subject Alternate Names (SAN). **SANs are half the price of a full
certificate so they should be used whenever and wherever possible.**

Digicert allows adding SANs interactively during the request process.

Or prepare an openssl config file, such as this _san.cnf_:

```
[ req ]
default_bits        = 2048
distinguished_name  = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions      = req_ext
[ req_distinguished_name ]
countryName         = GB
stateOrProvinceName = Greater Manchester
localityName        = Manchester
organizationName    = Department of Education
commonName          = additional-teaching-payment.education.gov.uk
[ req_ext ]
subjectAltName      = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1               = www.additional-teaching-payment.education.gov.uk
DNS.2               = staging.additional-teaching-payment.education.gov.uk
```

Then run:

```
openssl req -out sslcert.csr -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout private.key -config san.cnf
```

And confirm the answers interactively.

### Request new certificate in DigiCert
- [Login to Digicert](https://www.digicert.com/account/login.php) with your own account
- Select `Request a certificate` then `Secure Site OV`
- Paste the CSR
- Choose coverage for 1 or 2 years
- Add organization: Department For Education
- Additional emails: your team email
- Click `Submit request`


### Request new certificate in Globalsign
- Open [Globalsign portal](https://gcc.globalsign.com/au/signon/gacp/usernamePasswordLogin.do)
- Select _Managed SSL_
- Choose _Order Certificate_ from either _Department for Education_ or _Education & Skills Funding Agency_
- Paste the CSR created above
- Check this CSR, Continue
- Products: OrganizationSSL
- SSL Certificate Type: Single Domain Certificate
- Point of contact must have a team email email address, not an individual
- Tick box _Is this the Point of Contact for communications?_
- Continue until `Complete`

The [Platform support team](/infrastructure/support/#platform-support) will receive the request, validate and you will receive an email with the certificate in PEM (.cer) format.

### Convert to pfx format

It may be required to convert to pfx format, especially in Azure. It replaces pem certificate+private key with pfx certificate+password.

Using openssl:

```
openssl pkcs12 -export -out cert.pfx -inkey privatekey.key -in cert.cer
```

## Automatic via key vault

[Azure key vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/certificates/tutorial-rotate-certificates) can generate, renew and store the certificate automatically.

### Key vault account
A special "Key vault account" is required and must be approved on case by case basis. It can be requested via the
[Non-standard / Any Other Request](https://dfe.service-now.com.mcas.ms/serviceportal?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=3ab186f8db2c2b403b929334ca961998&sysparm_category=19d07bc3dbff17003b929334ca9619bd)
service portal form. The business service is _Shared IT core services_ and the offering is _SSL Certificate Authority Systems (external)_.

### Digicert CA
- If you don't have an API key, first login to Digicert with the Key vault account
- Click on `API keys` then `Add API key`
- Add a description
- API key restrictions: orders
- Click `Add API key` and keep note of the key. Ideally store it in a production Key vault secret.

In Key vault, click on `Certificates`, then `Certificate Authorities`, then `+`:

- Provider: Digicert
- Account ID: Cert central account number 1446606
- Account Password: API key as above
- Organization ID: CertCentral Department For Education Organization ID: 877555

### Globalsign CA
In Key vault, click on `Certificates`, then `Certificate Authorities`, then `+`:

- Provider: Globalsign
- Account ID: Key vault account username
- Account Password: Key vault account password
- E-mail of Administrator: The contact details should be for a team, not an individual

### Create certificate
- Create a certificate
  - Method: Generate
  - Name: Unique name (usually the subdomain)
  - Type of CA: integrated
  - CA: the CA created above
  - Subject (example):

    ```
    C=GB, ST=Greater Manchester, L=Manchester, O=Department for Education, CN=claim-additional-teaching-payment.service.gov.uk
    ```

  - DNS Names: list of additional domain names (SANs) to be covered by this certificate
  - Validity: 12 months
  - Content type: PKCS #12
  - Lifetime action type: Automatically renew at a given number of days before expiry
  - Number of days: 30
- Click Create
- Click Certificate Operation and wait for result

For Digicert, you must provide a team email as additional contact. This can only be done on the website:

- Login as the Key Vault account
- Click on Requests, click on the certificate, click on the order number
- Under `Additional email recipients` click `Add email`
- Enter the email and save

## Renewals

The certificates are monitored and owners are notified via email before expiry by either the provider or the [Platform support team](/infrastructure/support/#platform-support). If Key vault automated renewal is configured, this can be ignored.

## Check certificate

In order to view certificate expiry details such as expiry date, etc., you can run the following command to download the certificate currently being used on a website. In this example, we are focusing on _https://find-postgraduate-teacher-training.education.gov_.uk :

```
echo -n | openssl s_client -connect find-postgraduate-teacher-training.education.gov.uk:443 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > certoutput.cert
```

Once downloaded, you can run:

```
openssl x509 -in certoutput.cert -text
```
