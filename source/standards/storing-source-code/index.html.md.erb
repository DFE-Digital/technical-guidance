All our source code is open by default, and stored on well-known,
public code hosting services. At the DfE, we use GitHub.

We follow the principles set out in the service manual for managing the
code that we write:

- [use version control](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/maintaining-version-control-in-coding)
- [make source code open](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable)

You should keep secrets separate from source code, and keep them private.

## GitHub

New repositories for products and services live in the
[Department for Education Digital organisation](https://github.com/DfE-Digital)
on GitHub. New repositories must be created within the [Department for Education Digital](https://github.com/DFE-Digital) organisation, whether they contain service production code or prototypes. Work created outside of the DfE Digital organisation should be transferred into the DfE Digital organisation at the earliest opportunity. [Guide to transferring a repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/transferring-a-repository).

You can use your personal GitHub account (but you should [add your DfE
email address to your account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account/),
and [use it for notifications](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-emails-for-organizations/)).
Ask your delivery manager to request you being added to the Github organisation.

Another Github organisation account heavilly used by the DfE but not the default for DfE-Digital is ['SkillsFundingAgency'](https://github.com/SkillsFundingAgency/).

Repositories should be [clearly named](/standards/naming-things/),
and have an [appropriate licence](/standards/licencing-software-or-code)
and enough documentation that someone new can get started with the
project.

Private repositories are not a good way to protect secrets, and should only be used where access to the code might reveal draft policy decisions. Secrets should be managed at the platform level.
